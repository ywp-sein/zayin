# Zayin

This is the prayer space for our business.

>**Psalm 119:49-56**<br>
>*Zayin(×–)*<br>
>*Remember the word to Your servant,*<br>
>*Upon which You have caused me to hope.*<br>
>*This is my comfort in my affliction,*<br>
>*For Your word has given me life.*<br>
>*The proud have me in great derision,*<br>
>*Yet I do not turn aside from Your law.*<br>
>*I remembered Your judgments of old, O Lord,*<br>
>*And have comforted myself.*<br>
>*Indignation has taken hold of me*<br>
>*Because of the wicked, who forsake Your law.*<br>
>*Your statutes have been my songs*<br>
>*In the house of my pilgrimage.*<br>
>*I remember Your name in the night, O Lord,*<br>
>*And I keep Your law.*<br>
>*This has become mine,*<br>
>*Because I kept Your precepts.*
