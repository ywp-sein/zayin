Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for bringing this thought back to me. This year has truly been a time of preparation for this moment and for the future. Thank You for first growing my character, and now showing me that it is time to move forward. Right after I said “yes,” that I want and will be a leader, You revealed this grace to me. I know You are smiling right now. May You continue to reveal this path not only to me, but also to the people who will work with me.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for reminding me to write down Your grace in this way. May people witness how this business is blessed by You and grows only in the way You desire. This business belongs to You alone. And may those who love You be like the sun rising in its full strength.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for the tiredness I experience, and for reminding me that even when I am physically weary, I can still find spiritual peace in Your arms. Thank You that once again, as I learn to take care of myself through You, You do not condemn me but gently show me a better way. I will never be alone or fearful, because I have You. I love You, and You know.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.
