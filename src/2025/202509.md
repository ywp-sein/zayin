# 2025 September Prayers

## 0904
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for bringing this thought back to me. This year has truly been a time of preparation for this moment and for the future. Thank You for first growing my character, and now showing me that it is time to move forward. Right after I said “yes,” that I want and will be a leader, You revealed this grace to me. I know You are smiling right now. May You continue to reveal this path not only to me, but also to the people who will work with me.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.
