Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for bringing this thought back to me. This year has truly been a time of preparation for this moment and for the future. Thank You for first growing my character, and now showing me that it is time to move forward. Right after I said “yes,” that I want and will be a leader, You revealed this grace to me. I know You are smiling right now. May You continue to reveal this path not only to me, but also to the people who will work with me.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

## 0904
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for reminding me to write down Your grace in this way. May people witness how this business is blessed by You and grows only in the way You desire. This business belongs to You alone. And may those who love You be like the sun rising in its full strength.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

## 0905
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for the tiredness I experience, and for reminding me that even when I am physically weary, I can still find spiritual peace in Your arms. Thank You that once again, as I learn to take care of myself through You, You do not condemn me but gently show me a better way. I will never be alone or fearful, because I have You. I love You, and You know.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

## 0908
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Thank You for all the surprises on the weekend. Thank You for waking me up and not being late today. And You did teach me a lot of things through small things. Please help us to be faithful, even when no one sees, and remind us that You are watching us and willing to teach us all the time.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

## 0909
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Please help us to choose You in every situation, not merely logically and in principle, but with all our hearts, minds, souls, and strength. And thank You for giving us keywords to contemplate on how we can do our business. Lord, we want to be wealthy in the way that we can easily reach our brothers and sisters around the world, so please help us. Also, we want to become a blessing in the business world, so please help us not to compromise with mammon, but to use money as the means of blessings in Your way.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.

## 0910
Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
Please remove the concept of deadline in us, we don't need that. Because we want to do everything in Your time. And that's is enough.<br>
In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,<br>
Amen.
